/**
 * This module handles the spawning of player characters in the game world.
 * It exports the following:
 * - `CHAR_VALS`: A nullable object of type `CharacterValues` that holds the character data of the player.
 * - `DEFAULT_SPAWN`: A constant object of type `SpawnLocation` that holds the default spawn location of the player.
 * - `firstSpawn()`: An async function that spawns the player character in the game world.
 * - `openCharacterCreator(identifiers: CharacterValues | null)`: A function that opens the character creator UI.
 * - `setNuiFocus()`: A function that sets the NUI focus.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This module listens to the following events:
 * - `MUTINY:CORE:CLIENT:SPAWN_HANDLER`: An event that sets the `CHAR_VALS` object with the character data of the player.
 * - `onClientGameTypeStart`: An event that triggers the spawning of the player character.
 * - `MUTINY:CORE:CLIENT:OPEN_CHARACTER_SELECTOR`: An event that opens the character selector UI.
 *
